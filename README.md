# jira-tabular-nums

`font-variant: tabular-nums` is a CSS property that makes all of your numerals the same width. This is really useful for tables and aligned data. For Jira the fact that our avatars didn't always line up (and as a consequence the Epic labels didn't either) really bothered me. This fixes that! And the best part of this solution? I wrote zero Javascript ðŸ˜Ž
